# multiplex

A binary stream multiplexer. Stream multiple streams of binary data over a single binary stream. Like [mux-demux](https://npmjs.org/package/mux-demux) but faster since it only works with binary streams.

## api

### `var multiplex = require('multiplex')([options], [onStream])`

Returns a new multiplexer. You can use this to create sub-streams. All data written to sub-streams will be emitted through this. If you pipe a multiplex instance to another multiplex instance all substream data will be multiplexed and demultiplexed on the other end.

`onStream` will be called with `(stream, id)` whenever a new remote sub-stream is created with an id that hasn't already been created with `.createStream`.

Options include:

* `opts.limit` - set the max allowed message size. default is no maximum

Any other options set in `options` are used as defaults options when creating sub streams.

### `stream = multiplex.createStream([id], [options])`

Creates a new sub-stream with an optional whole string `id` (default is the stream channel id).

Sub-streams are duplex streams.

Options include:

* `opts.chunked` - enables chunked mode on all streams (message framing not guaranteed)
* `opts.halfOpen` - make channels support half open mode meaning that they can be readable but not writable and vice versa

### `stream = multiplex.receiveStream(id, [options])`

Explicitly receive an incoming stream.

This is useful if you have a function that accepts an instance of multiplex
and you want to receive a substream.

### `stream = multiplex.createSharedStream(id, [options])`

Create a shared stream. If both ends create a shared stream with
the same id, writing data on one end will emit the same data on the other end

## events

### `multiplex.on('error', function (err) {})`

Emitted when the outer stream encounters invalid data

### `multiplex.on('stream', function (stream, id) {})`

Emitted when a it a new stream arrives.

### `stream.on('error', function (err) {})`

Emitted if the inner stream is destroyed with an error

### example

```js
var multiplex = require('multiplex')
var plex1 = multiplex()
var stream1 = plex1.createStream()
var stream2 = plex1.createStream()

var plex2 = multiplex(function onStream(stream, id) {
  stream.on('data', function(c) {
    console.log('data', id, c.toString())
  })
})

plex1.pipe(plex2)

stream1.write(Buffer.from('stream one!'))
stream2.write(Buffer.from('stream two!'))
```
